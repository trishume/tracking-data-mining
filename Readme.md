# Active_Shipping mass tracking data mining

Just a hacky script to batch query tracking data and analyze the results.
Used to determine reliability of tracking info returned by carriers.
Currently only works for USPS.

No data or results are included since this script was run on a private database of tracking numbers,
read from a CSV file from a database.
